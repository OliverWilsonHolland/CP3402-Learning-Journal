## Estimated Hours
~ 5-6 hours

## Content Insights
WordPress CMS is much easier to use and more user friendly than Joomla. The UI is more intuitive, page creation more straight forward, and there are more learning resources available as well. 

Editing the Theme file is extremely powerful as it allows for customisation to be pushed to the whole site.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I use WordPress at work, arguably with a pager layer plugin however learning to use WordPressâ€™s already powerful capabilities is a useful skill for personal and employment reasons. 
In future I don't think this will assist in the career I am looking to pursue. However, it is a good skill for me to develop for the job I'm currently in.
