## Content Insights
Having had a long break since last creating websites manually, I went through and revised the html and css syntax and conventions. I used videos and looked at previous site I made. By Relearning in this way, found it easy to get back into the flow of coding in html and css.

After selecting my hosting platform of Hostinger I went though and watched some of their how to videos on using their platform. Hostinger is easy to use and supports multiple different CMS options which are easy to intergrate from their platform. Their online editor made it easy to use as I had to do this from my laptop which doesn't have any IDEs on it.

When looking for resources for simple static menus or even just a page layout template. I found that almost all of them were responsive. The simple html solutions other than on W3schools were almost impossible to find. This makes sense given that everyone is using a vast range of different devices to access the web and content needs to be viewable on all of them.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After trying to ingest as much knowledge as efficiently as possible I reaffirmed how I learn best. This isn't really a knew insight, but I found interacting with the material and having audio visual content made it much easier for me to ingest and retain.
